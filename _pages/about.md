Hi, I am Ruirong Chen. I am currently a forth year Ph.D student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Pittsburgh. I am conducting research in 
Network and system lab under supervision of Dr.Wei Gao.

My research interests include wireless networks, wireless sensing, Internet of Things and smart health systems. During my current Ph.D studies, I am very active in discovering new problems in cutting edge systems and innvoating applicatable solutions to these problems.  I proposed a new wireless system that bridge tha gap between obsolete and new wireless devices by emulating arbitrary wireless signals from a commodity WiFi device. Moreover, aiming to resolve the cross-technology coexistence, I have designed a WiFi PHY layer that  enables the cross-technology coexistence between strong and weak wireless devices. I also assisted in designing a multi-access wireless side channel that enables multiple side channel devices accessing the main channel. 

These works have turned into publications in top conferences, e.g ACM MOBICOM,ACM CoNEXT, HotMobile and IEEE INFOCOM.

I am a big fan of traveling, hiking, reading and building Legos.
